## Prerequisites/Dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies and prerequisites for the task, follow the instructions [**here**](https://brown-ccv.github.io/honeycomb-docs/docs/quick_start#installing-prerequisites) until the end of the page

If you don't have some fundamental prerequisites like git installed, follow the instructions [**here**](https://brown-ccv.github.io/honeycomb-docs/docs/prerequisites):

## Starting a development server

To get started running a local development server, you'll need to run these few commands (**note that you'll need two separate terminal windows open**):

`cd src` + `node server.js` _(assuming you're in the root directory)_

`npm run dev` _(assuming you're in root directory)_

This should start a live development server where you can freely make updates/changes which are reflected immediately

To run an alternative version of the experiment that requires you to click the spacebar on color changes, use the following commands:

`cd src` + `node server.js` _(assuming you're in the root directory)_

`npm run dev:spacebar` _(assuming you're in root directory)_

To run an alternative version of the experiment with a short **tutorial** at the beginning consisting of 5 videos, use the following commands:

`cd src` + `node server.js` _(assuming you're in the root directory)_

`npm run dev:tutorial` _(assuming you're in root directory)_
